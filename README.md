Frontend developer
------------------

I am a front-end developer who focuses on HTML and CSS. Worked with online stores and online education services. I am attentive to licenses and believe that if you do not want or can't buy a proprietary product, you can always find an open-source alternative. I believe that there is no need to create special versions of websites for people with disabilities. It is necessary to make the sites initially accessible to everyone.

*   🚀  I'm currently working on [Дока — a kindly encyclopedia about web development in Russian](http://doka.guide)
*   🧠  I'm learning a11ty, JS
*   🤝  I'm open to collaborating on cool open-source projects
*   ⚡  I am open to new career opportunities.
